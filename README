SHOUTcast Recorder
==================
Author : Yoann Sculo

SHOUTcast Recorder is able to record and store SHOUTcast stream automatically
into mp3 format with ID3Tags.

How does it work ?
==================

- Curl receives HTTP blocks
- For each block received, we parse every bytes
- For each byte, we look for :
   - ICY header
   - potential metadata blocks
   - mp3data we store in memory
- At the end of each block, we write gathered MP3 data into an external file
- Now we can enjoy downloaded music :)
